A Node.js API powering compassionate, wisdom-driven chatbots—blending Buddhist mindfulness, Taoist simplicity, and modern mental health principles. Designed for developers building reflective, non-judgmental AI companions.

Key Features:
Gentle Wisdom: Responses rooted in Eastern philosophy and therapeutic practices

Privacy-First: Local conversation storage (JSON)

Minimalist API: Express.js + Hugging Face LLMs (Zephyr)

Safe Space: Rate-limited, session-based, and emotionally aware error handling

"Not therapy, but a digital companion—here to listen."
